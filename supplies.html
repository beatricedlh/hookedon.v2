            <h4>YARN</h4>
        </div>

            <p>Exploring the world of yarn can be an adventure! 
                Whether you're strolling through the yarn aisle or browsing online, you'll find a vast array of choices. 
                Yarn comes in different weights and fibers, each offering its own unique qualities. 
                Here's what to look out for: </p>

                <ul class="a">
                    <li><span class="underline"><strong>Weight: </strong></span>Yarn thickness is indicated by a number from 0 to 7, with 0 being the thinnest and 7 the thickest.</li>
                    <li><span class="underline"><strong>Fiber: </strong></span><u></u>Yarn can be made from various fibers, including natural and synthetic options.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>For beginners, it's often recommended to start with medium (4) or bulky (5) weight yarn. 
            These are easy to handle and readily available. 
            Acrylic yarn or acrylic blends are great choices for beginners due to their affordability, accessibility, and easy care!

            <h4>HOOKS</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p> Althought there are several different types of crochet hooks, they all have one thing in common: a hook at the end! Most hooks are made of aluminum, plastic, or wood.
                You can catch and manipulate the yarn with the head, which is located at the end of your crochet hook. 
                Behind the head is the shank, followed by a flat portion, aka the grip, and finally the handle. The flat portion is where you place your fingers to control the hook.</p>

            <p>For practice, we recommend using a medium hook, like a H (5mm or size 7).
